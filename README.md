1.1 Store & Display Values in Different Variables: Create and display variables of different data types, including Integer, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean, and String
1.2.	Type Conversion: Perform type conversions such as Integer to Double, String to Integer, and String to Double.
1.3.	Scan studentâ€™s information and display all the data: Input and display data of students, including their name, enrolment no, branch,etc.
1.4.	Check Odd or Even Numbers: Determine whether a number is odd or even using control flow within println() method
1.5.	Display Month Name: Use a when expression to display the month name based on user input.
1.6.	User-Defined Function: Create a user-defined function to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two number
1.7.	Factorial Calculation with Recursion: Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
1.8.	Working with Arrays: Explore array operations such as Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), IntArray.joinToString(), and use them to print arrays. Utilize various loop types like range, downTo, until, etc., to manipulate arrays. Sort an array of integers both without using built-in functions and with built-in functions.
1.9.	Find Maximum Number from ArrayList: Write a program to find the maximum number from an ArrayList of integers
1.10. Class and Constructor Creation: Define different classes and constructors. Create a "Car" class with properties like type, model, price, owner, and miles driven. Implement functions to get car information, original car price, current car price, and display car information
1.11. Operator Overloading and Matrix Operations: Explain operator overloading and implement matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication using a "Matrix" class. Overload the toString() function in the "Matrix" class for customized output.
